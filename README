This is intended to be a set of relatively simple scripts to manage a GPG-encrypted password safe file.

A better way might honestly be to keep each file separate; this will let you see what you have, and alter and search them
more individually; each one will just contain a date, username, and password.

Right now you can just add or search for a password

...a better way might be to have it open a vim window or something so you can scroll through and highlight the ones you
want.  But that has issues because a) I want to avoid ever creating a temporary file of decrypted stuff even for an
instant, and b) it makes you more vulnerable to shoulder-surfing.

But having to put in a password every time you want to get a password doesn't... really... make sense.

We could solve problem (a) by just piping output to less.  That also lets you search and all that such, but also lets
people screen-surf much more effectively.

Hmm.
